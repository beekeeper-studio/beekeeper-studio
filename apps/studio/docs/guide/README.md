## Connecting to a Database

The connection screen allows you to enter connection information for your database.

Note - Beekeeper Studio does not support unix socket connections for PSQL or MYSQL, only TCP connections.

### SSL

There are three ways to connect to a database with SSL
1. **Trust the server:** Connect with SSL without providing your own certificate.
2. **Required Cert:** Connect with SSL, provide your own certs, and disable `rejectUnauthorized`.
3. **Verified Cert:** Connect with SSL, provide your own certs, and enable `rejectUnauthorized`.

Here's a table of how the various `sslmode` flags from command line clients map to Beekeeper:

| sslmode | Turn on SSL? | rejectUnauthorized |
|------|-----|-----|
| disable |	no | 	n/a |
| allow |	no | 	n/a |
| prefer |	no | 	n/a |
| require |	yes | 	false |
| verify-ca |	yes | 	false |
| verify-full |	yes | 	true |

### SSH Tunnel

To connect to a remote database using your SSH account on that machine:

1. **Activate the SSH Tunnel** to reveal the ssh connection detail fields

2. **Enter the SSH Hostname** or IP address of the remote SSH server

3. **Change the SSH server's Port** if it doesn't accept connections on the default port 22

4. **Enter Bastion Host (JumpHost)** (optional) if your server's network requires that you connect through a [JumpHost](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/ssh-proxy-bastion-proxyjump)

5. **Enter the Keepalive Interval** (optional) to specify, _in seconds_, how often to ping the server while idle to prevent getting disconnected due to a timeout.  This is equivalent to the [ServerAliveInterval](https://superuser.com/questions/37738/how-to-reliably-keep-an-ssh-tunnel-open#answer-601644) option you might use on the ssh commmand line, or in your `~/.ssh/config` file -- **Entering 0 (zero) disables this feature**

6. **Select your SSH Authentication method**:

    * `SSH Agent` if your local machine is running an SSH Agent, you only need to provide the remote **SSH Username** of your ssh account on the server

    * `Username and Password` to enter both your **SSH Username** and **SSH Password** (also see the _Save Passwords_ option, below)

    * `Key File` Select your **SSH Private key File** (and optionally enter your **Key File PassPhrase**) if you use your [SSH Public Key](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7260/how-do-i-setup-public-key-authentication#answers-header) on the server for authentication

7. **Enter a name for your Connection** (optionally check the **Save Passords** checkbox) and Press **Save** to have Beekeeper remember all of the above for you

8. **Press the Connect button** to access your database!

Once you are connected to your database Beekeeper Studio allows you to open tabs to do the following things:

1. SQL Editor: Write and execute SQL Queries (this is what tabs do by default)
2. Table Explorer: View table contents

## File Associations

Beekeeper Studio provides file associations so you can do the following things without opening the app:

- Double click a sqlite `.db` file in a file browser to open it in Beekeeper Studio!
- Open URLs and files from the terminal:
  - Mac: `open postgresql://user@host/database` or `open ./example.db`
  - Linux: `xdg-open postgresql://user@host/database` or `xdg-open ./example.db`


## SQL Editor

Writing SQL is such a fundamental part of interacting with a relational database that we put this functionality front and center.

You can use the SQL query tab to write, and run, SQL queries quickly and easily.

### Code Completion

We have tried to make our code completion useful but not intrusive. 

Code suggestions will automatically appear in the following situations:

- `tables` will be suggested after typing `from` or `join`
- `columns` will be suggested after typing a tablename, or table alias, followed by a period, eg `film.`

In these situations, Beekeeper will automatically resolve the correct table and column names for the entity you are querying.

Oh, you want to manually trigger code-suggestions? The default key combo is `Ctrl+Space`, or `Cmd+Space`.

### Run Contexts

If you like writing big long SQL scripts with multiple queries in the same editor pane (I know I do), you might want to only run a portion of your script at a time.

Beekeeper allows you to:

1. Run everything (this is the default)
2. Run only the 'current' query (Beekeeper highlights this query for you so you know what will run)
3. Run only what you have selected.

### Query Parameters

You can parameterize your queries and Beekeeper will prompt you for values when you run it.

You can use two types of syntax `:variable`, or `$1`

```sql
select * from table where foo = :one and bar = :two

select * from table where foo = $1 and bar = $2
```

## Table Explorer

Click the little `open` button next to a table name to open the table in a table-tab.

Now you can filter, sort, and explore your table data all day.

### Edit Table Data

Assuming your table has a (single) primary key, you can edit your data right inside of Beekeeper Studio. Don't worry, Beekeeper stages your changes so you can discard them if you make a mistake.

Ways to edit data:
1. Click a cell to edit the contents
2. Right click a row and select `clone` to duplicate the row
3. Right click a row and select `delete` to delete the row
4. Click ⚙ and select `Add Row` to create a new row

After editing data, click `Commit` in the table footer to commit your changes.

> **Note** if you sort or filter the table while editing you will discard your changes.

### Export Table Data

Click the ⚙ icon in the table footer and select `Export` to export table data to CSV, JSON, or SQL formats.

You can export either the entire table, or the currently filtered view.
