# Release 3.9 - Slow burn, but less slow now

My wife had heart surgery in Feb (she's doing great!) and I've been helping her recover, so it's been a while since the last Beekeeper Studio release (It's not a coincidence that I put out a super stable release at the end of Jan).

If you are a customer of the commercial edition - üôè Thank you, your financial support makes all of this possible.

If you use the community edition, please consider upgrading to the [commercial edition](https://docs.beekeeperstudio.io/docs/upgrading-from-the-community-edition). Every purchase supports me, and the continued development of the community edition.

I also have a few part time folks helping me keep Beekeeper Studio features rolling:
- @wmontgomery
- @not-night-but
- @davidkaufman

Big thanks to them for their help.
