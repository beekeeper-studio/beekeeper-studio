# Snowflake Client Implementation for Beekeeper Studio

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Fixed incorrect imports in the snowflake.ts file - importing types properly
- ✅ Implemented the missing `getColumnsAndTotalRows` method required for the `queryStream` functionality
- ✅ Created a proper implementation of the Snowflake client in the commercial directory
- ✅ Added the client to the list of available database clients
- ✅ Implemented a mock version of `rawExecuteQuery` to enable development without Snowflake SDK

## Next Steps for Production-Ready Implementation

1. Add the Snowflake SDK:
   ```bash
   yarn add snowflake-sdk
   ```

2. Uncomment the real Snowflake connection code in `rawExecuteQuery` and remove the mock implementation.

3. Add proper type definitions for Snowflake objects:
   ```typescript
   interface SnowflakeOptions {
     account?: string;
     warehouse?: string;
     role?: string;
     authenticator?: string;
     browserFlow?: boolean;
   }
   ```

4. Implement Snowflake-specific helpers for different data types to improve the `parseTableColumn` method.

5. Create a Snowflake-specific SQL dialect for better query editor support:
   - Create a new dialect file in `shared/lib/dialects/snowflake.ts`
   - Add Snowflake-specific keywords and functions
   - Update the client to use this dialect

6. Add a UI connection form component for Snowflake in `src/components/connection/SnowflakeForm.vue`

7. Add comprehensive testing:
   - Unit tests for the client
   - Integration tests with Snowflake

## Development Notes

- The current implementation uses mock data for responses to enable development without an active Snowflake connection
- For a production version, the commented code in the `rawExecuteQuery` method needs to be uncommented and the Snowflake SDK needs to be added
- The Snowflake client is set to read-only mode as most clients start in this mode

## Snowflake-Specific Considerations

- Snowflake uses a different connection paradigm from other databases, requiring account, warehouse, and role parameters
- Snowflake uses uppercase identifiers by default, so all identifiers are wrapped in double quotes
- Snowflake doesn't use traditional indexes - it organizes data using micro-partitions and clustering keys
- Snowflake query execution should use the statement API from the SDK for best performance
