## Why Upgrade Beekeeper Studio?

That's easy -- a whole bunch of useful features are only available in the paid version of Beekeeper Studio.

A couple examples of paid features include a **JSON row viewer** and support for ClickHouse databases.

There are a lot more, you can see them all [on the pricing page](https://beekeeperstudio.io/pricing).


## Purchases support a small independent team

Beekeeper Studio is run by a small team. We've bootstrapped Beekeeper Studio from nothing without family money, VC investment, or a corporate sponsor.

Building quality software is hard work, especially for such a small team! Even so we're committed to open sourcing the [majority of our code base](https://github.com/beekeeper-studio/beekeeper-studio), and offering a lot of features for free.

When you buy a copy of Beekeeper Studio you directly support our business, and our efforts in open source. Thank you! üôè
