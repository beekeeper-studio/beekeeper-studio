# Introduction

!!! warning "Beta Feature"
    The plugin system is in beta (available in Beekeeper Studio 5.3+). Things might change, but we'd love your feedback!

The Beekeeper Studio Plugin System allows developers to extend the application's functionality through user interface (UI). Plugins run in an `<iframe>` which means they are sandboxed and communicate with the main application through a structured API.

## What Are Plugins?

Plugins are web apps (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that run inside Beekeeper Studio to provide additional functionality.

## How Plugins Work

Beekeeper Studio plugins run as standalone web apps embedded inside an `<iframe>`. Each plugin is isolated and communicates with the host application using [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage).

Here's a breakdown of the internal flow:

### 1. Plugin Discovery

Beekeeper Studio fetches a plugin index (a JSON file) from the central plugin registry:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beekeeper-studio/beekeeper-studio-plugins/main/plugins.json
```

Each entry in this file points to a plugin manifest, which contains metadata, UI configuration, and the plugin entry point URL.

You can explore or contribute to the plugin registry on GitHub: [beekeeper-studio/beekeeper-studio-plugins](https://github.com/beekeeper-studio/beekeeper-studio-plugins)

### 2. Installation

When a plugin is installed via the Plugin Manager:

- The plugin's manifest is downloaded.

- The manifest points to a `.zip` archive containing the plugin bundle (HTML/CSS/JS assets).

- The archive is unpacked and stored locally inside Beekeeper Studio's plugin directory.

### 3. Sandboxed Execution

Each plugin is loaded into an `<iframe>` with `sandbox` attributes, limiting access to the host environment unless explicitly permitted via the plugin API. The iframe is served using a custom Electron protocol: `plugin://`, which is defined specifically for Beekeeper Studio. This protocol helps isolate plugins from external web content and is only accessible within the Beekeeper Studio application.

### 4. Message-Passing Communication

Plugins communicate with Beekeeper Studio using `postMessage`. This system supports two kinds of messages: **requests** and **notifications**.

- A **request** expects a response. For example, calling `getTables` will return a list of tables.

- A **notification** sends data without expecting a reply. For instance, when the theme changes, Beekeeper Studio notifies the plugin via a `themeChanged` notification.

The [@beekeeperstudio/plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@beekeeperstudio/plugin) package provides helper functions for handling communication such as `getTables()`, `runQuery()`, etc.

### 5. UI Integration

Plugins declare their views (tabs or sidebars) in the manifest file. Beekeeper Studio renders these views dynamically and injects the corresponding `<iframe>` into the designated location in the UI.
