# Plugins

Plugins extend Beekeeper Studio with additional functionality, bringing new tools and capabilities directly into your database workflow. Think of them as specialized add-ons that enhance what you can do with your data.

## What are Plugins?

Plugins are mini-applications that run inside Beekeeper Studio to provide specialized functionality. They appear as new tabs or sidebar panels, integrating seamlessly with the rest of the interface.

Each plugin operates in its own secure environment while having access to your database connections and query capabilities through a controlled interface.

## Who Can Use Plugins?

Plugins are available to **all Beekeeper Studio users**, including those using the free Community Edition.

However, some individual plugins may have their own access requirements. For example, premium plugins developed by the Beekeeper Studio team may require a paid subscription.

The AI Shell plugin brings artificial intelligence directly into your database workflow. Ask questions about your data in plain English and get intelligent responses powered by AI.

The AI Shell appears as a new tab type that you can open alongside your regular query tabs, with a built-in result viewer for any queries it runs.
