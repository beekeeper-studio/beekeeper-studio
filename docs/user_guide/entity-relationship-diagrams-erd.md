To visualize your database schema, Beekeeper Studio provides Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). It gives you a clear, interactive view of how your tables connect, so you can understand the structure at a glance.

## Multi-schema Relationship

The diagram can display relationships that cross schema boundaries. Tables from other schemas still appear in the view, but with a clear visual distinction so you always know when a relationship extends beyond the active schema.

## Export as Image

You can save the current diagram as an image or copy it to your clipboard. This makes it easy to share the layout or include it in documentation.

## How to Open the ER Diagram

You can open the diagram from **Tools > Open ER Diagram** to view the active database.
