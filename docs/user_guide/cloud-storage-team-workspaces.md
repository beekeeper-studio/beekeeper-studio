Workspaces make it easy to work on multiple computers by storing your data (connections and queries) in the cloud.

Even better, workspaces allow multiple people to work from the same set of data collaboratively.

Queries and Connections stored in a workspace are only available for use through the Beekeeper Studio app, not through a web interface.

## Concepts

1. **Workspace** - An online collaborative space for `members` to work on `queries` and `connections`. You get one of these when you create a subscription on the [account dashboard](https://app.beekeeperstudio.io)
2. **Workspace Member** - Someone with access to view and edit queries & connections.
3. **Workspace Admin** - A workspace member with additional privileges, including the ability to invite new users to the workspace.
4. **Workspace Owner** - The person who created the workspace. Owners can add and remove members, promote members to admins, and manage the workspace.
5. **Personal Folder** - Every workspace member has a `personal` folder where new queries and connections are saved by default. Items in your personal folder are *not* shared with others.
6. **Team Folder** - If you want to share a connection or query with teammates, move it to the team folder. Everyone in the workspace has access to this folder.

## Workspace Access

Workspaces are free so long as you maintain an active Beekeeper Studio subscription.

## Getting Started

It only takes a few minutes to get started with workspaces.

### 1. Sign up and create a workspace

Workspaces must be created and managed through the [Beekeeper Studio dashboard][dashboard].

Simply sign in and click `New Workspace` to create a new workspace.

### 2. Start using your workspace

Open the Beekeeper Studio app and sign in to your account by clicking on the avatar icon in the bottom of the left sidebar.

Once you're signed in to your account, all of your workspaces will appear in the sidebar for you to use.

After connecting to a workspace, Beekeeper works just the same as it does usually, except anything you save will be available across all of your devices.

## Managing Workspace Members

### Inviting Users

Both workspace owners and admins can invite new users to join the workspace:

1. Sign in to your workspace in Beekeeper Studio
2. Click on the workspace name in the sidebar
3. Select "Invite Users" from the menu
4. Enter the email address of the person you want to invite
5. The invitee will receive an email with instructions to join your workspace

### Managing Admin Privileges

The workspace owner can promote regular members to admins:

1. Sign in to the [Beekeeper Studio dashboard][dashboard]
2. Navigate to your workspace settings
3. Find the member in the list and click "Promote to Admin"

Admins can invite new users but cannot promote other members to admin status or remove the admin status of other members. Only the workspace owner has these privileges.

## Deleting a Workspace

The owner of the workspace can delete it from the [dashboard][dashboard]. If you delete your workspace, your data will be archived for 30 days, then permanently deleted with no way to recover it.
