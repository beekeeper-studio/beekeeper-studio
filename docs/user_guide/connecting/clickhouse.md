## Advanced ClickHouse Settings (Optional)

For users needing advanced configurations:

- TLS/SSL Settings: If your ClickHouse server requires a secure connection, expand the TLS/SSL settings and configure the necessary certificates and keys if necessary.
- SSH Tunnel: If you need to connect to your ClickHouse server via an SSH tunnel, you can configure the SSH settings by expanding the SSH Tunnel settings and configuring the necessary SSH server details.
