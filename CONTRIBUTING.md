## Contributing Guidelines

Last updated: Feb 27 2022

We welcome community contributions! If you're thinking of contributing, thank you!

We ask that all contributors abide by our [code of conduct](https://github.com/beekeeper-studio/beekeeper-studio/code_of_conduct.md)


### Opening Issues

We have templates for questions, features, or bug reports, please follow the directions in these templates, but generally:

- Please give as much detail as possible about the feature or issue.
- Include OS, database type, database version, and app version
- Include steps to replicate (eg the SQL to run)

### Pull Requests

It's usually best to open an issue before spending a lot of time working on the code, just in case someone else is working on the same problem. We're always happy to discuss how to implement or design things to help you before you begin work.

Sometimes we don't merge pull requests if they don't meet our design goals, but we really never want this to happen, so please talk to us!

### Legal

All contributions to this repository are made under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

#### What this means practically

If you make a PR, the PR code is licensed as MIT. As soon as I copy (merge) the code into this repository it is then made available under the GPLv3 as part of Beekeeper Studio. The code is still copyright to you, and your original MIT license still applies to the code in your PR. The MIT license requires that I maintain the copyright notice, which is made available below.

#### Why do it this way

Practically speaking, we need to have the ability to change the Beekeeper Studio license in the future if we need to, by providing your contributions under the MIT license, we can do so without requiring that all contributors sign a [CLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) or hand over their copyright to us. This is a pretty common way to manage contributions for a large-ish open source project, so it should be totally fine for 99% of contributors.
